# OPENGL RAYCAST PROJECT

### 1. What is raycast?
Raycasting is a technique used in computer graphics, simulations, and game development to determine what a "ray" intersects with in a 3D or 2D space. Imagine shining a laser pointer (a ray) into a scene â€” raycasting is the process of figuring out what that laser hits first.

**How it works**:

- A ray is a line starting at a point (origin) and extending in a particular direction.

- Raycasting checks if and where this ray intersects with objects in the environment.

For this project, the focus will be on a 2 dimentional implementation, through a shadow generation alogrithm utilizing raycasting
